# Get Rid of Those Stubborn Brown Spots

**Vicaria Health | Downtown Hamilton**

---

They look like someone stuck bits of brown wax to your skin.

Maybe they started as flat spots and grew raised and bumpy over time. Maybe you thought they were moles or age spots—but they're not quite either. They're different from [skin tags](/service/skin-tag-removal) (those soft, hanging flaps), [milia](/service/milia-removal) (tiny white bumps), or [cherry angiomas](/service/ruby-points-treatment) (small red dots). These are something else entirely.

You've tried fading creams. You've Googled "how to remove seborrheic keratosis at home." You've considered just ignoring them—but they keep showing up in mirrors, photos, and on more parts of your body.

**Here's the truth:** Seborrheic keratoses are harmless, but they're stubborn as hell. Creams won't touch them. Home remedies don't work. And trying to scrape them off yourself is a recipe for infection and scarring.

**The good news?** We remove them every day. Safely. Effectively. So you can stop worrying about them.

## What Exactly Is Seborrheic Keratosis?

Let's clear this up first.

Seborrheic keratoses (SK for short) are benign skin growths that show up as you age. They're incredibly common—most people over 50 have at least a few.

They can look like:
- Brown, tan, or black spots
- Waxy, scaly patches that look "stuck on" to the skin
- Raised bumps with a rough texture
- Flat spots that gradually thicken over time

**Common locations:**
- Face (especially temples and forehead)
- Chest and back
- Scalp
- Shoulders

They're **not** cancerous. They're **not** contagious. They won't turn into skin cancer. But they can look similar to melanoma or other concerning lesions—which is why having a doctor check them is smart.

## Why People Live With Them (And Why You Don't Have To)

Most people don't know what these growths are, so they just... live with them.

Maybe you assumed they were age spots and there's nothing you could do. Maybe you thought removal would be expensive or complicated. Maybe you're just used to seeing them there.

**Here's the thing:** You don't have to.

Removal is straightforward, quick, and done by medical professionals who know exactly what they're doing. Most people wish they'd done it years earlier.

We see patients from all over Hamilton—Westdale, the Mountain, Dundas, Ancaster, Stoney Creek—who are tired of these growths showing up everywhere and just want them gone.

## How We Remove Seborrheic Keratoses

We use **electrocautery**—a precise, medical-grade technique that removes the growths cleanly and safely.

**Here's how it works:**

We apply a controlled electrical current to the seborrheic keratosis, which gently burns away the tissue layer by layer. The cauterization also seals the area, so there's minimal bleeding and clean healing.

The process takes just a few minutes per lesion. You might feel a brief warm sensation or slight pressure, but it's not painful. For sensitive areas or larger lesions, we can apply a topical numbing agent to keep you comfortable.

**Why electrocautery?**

✓ **Complete removal** — We take off the entire growth, not just the surface
✓ **Controlled and precise** — We treat only the SK, leaving healthy skin intact
✓ **Minimal bleeding** — Cauterization seals as it removes
✓ **Works on all types** — Flat, raised, thick, or thin—we can handle it
✓ **Clean healing** — Properly done, scarring is minimal or nonexistent

## Common Questions You're Probably Wondering

**Does it hurt?**
Most people describe it as a brief warm sensation or light pinch. If you're concerned, we can use a topical numbing agent to make it even more comfortable. The procedure is quick—much easier than most people expect.

**Will it leave a scar?**
When done properly by medical professionals, scarring is rare and usually minimal. The area may look slightly pink for a few weeks, then it fades to match your surrounding skin tone.

**Can I just ignore them?**
You can—they're harmless. But many people remove them because they're cosmetically bothersome, get irritated by clothing or jewelry, or simply want clearer skin. It's totally your call.

**Are they dangerous?**
No. Seborrheic keratoses are benign and won't turn into cancer. **However**, some skin cancers (like melanoma) can look similar. That's why it's smart to have a doctor examine any new or changing skin growth.

**How much does it cost?**
Depends on how many lesions you're having removed. We'll give you transparent pricing during your consultation. Most people find it more affordable than they expected.

**Will they come back?**
The specific growths we remove won't grow back. But if you're prone to seborrheic keratoses, new ones may develop elsewhere over time. That's normal—and we can remove those too when they appear.

**Can I remove them at home?**
Please don't. Home removal methods (freezing kits, acids, scraping) can cause infection, scarring, or damage to healthy skin. Plus, if what you think is a seborrheic keratosis is actually something else, removing it improperly could be dangerous. Let us handle it safely.
