They look like tiny red dots scattered across your skin.

Maybe you've had one or two for years. Maybe they're multiplying—showing up on your chest, arms, stomach, back. They're small, bright red, and they stand out every time you look in the mirror.

You've Googled them. You've wondered if they're dangerous. You know they're not [skin tags](/service/skin-tag-removal) (those are flesh-colored and hang off), not [milia](/service/milia-removal) (those are white bumps), and not [seborrheic keratoses](/service/seborrheic-keratosis-removal) (those are brown and waxy). These are something different—small red spots that won't go away.

You've thought about covering them with makeup or just learning to live with them.

**Here's what you need to know:** Ruby points (also called cherry angiomas) are harmless. But they're stubborn—they won't fade or disappear on their own. And they tend to multiply as you age.

The good news? We can remove them quickly, safely, and permanently.

## What Are Ruby Points (Cherry Angiomas)?

Let's get clear on what these are.

Ruby points—medically called cherry angiomas—are small, bright red bumps made of clustered blood vessels. They're incredibly common, especially in adults over 30.

**What they look like:**
- Tiny red or purple dots (usually 1-4mm in diameter)
- Smooth or slightly raised
- Bright red, cherry red, or deep purple color
- Don't blanch (turn white) when you press on them

**Where they appear:**
- Chest and torso (most common)
- Arms and shoulders
- Back
- Face and scalp
- Legs

They're **benign**—not cancerous, not dangerous. But if you bump or scratch one, it can bleed quite a bit because they're made of blood vessels.

Most people develop more ruby points as they age. They don't go away on their own, and there's no cream or lotion that will make them disappear.

## Why They Bother People (And Why You Don't Have to Live With Them)

Most people ignore ruby points at first. One or two red dots? No big deal.

But then more show up. And more. They start clustering on your chest or arms. You feel self-conscious in tank tops or swimsuits. You notice them in every photo.

Maybe you've tried covering them with makeup. Maybe you've resigned yourself to just having them. Maybe you've thought about removal but assumed it would be complicated or expensive.

**Here's the reality:** Ruby point removal is straightforward, quick, and done by medical professionals. Most people wish they'd done it sooner.

We see patients from all over Hamilton—Westdale, the Mountain, Dundas, Ancaster, Stoney Creek—who are tired of seeing red spots multiply and just want clear, even-toned skin.

## How We Remove Ruby Points

We use **electrocautery**—a precise, medical technique that removes cherry angiomas cleanly and effectively.

**Here's how it works:**

We apply a controlled electrical current directly to the ruby point. This cauterizes (burns away) the clustered blood vessels and seals the area instantly. The red spot is gone, and because we're cauterizing as we treat, there's minimal bleeding.

The entire process takes just seconds per ruby point. You might feel a brief warm sensation or tiny pinch, but it's quick and well-tolerated. Most people are surprised by how fast and easy it is.

**Why electrocautery?**

✓ **Immediate removal** The ruby point is gone on the spot
✓ **Minimal bleeding** Cauterization seals blood vessels as we treat
✓ **Precise and controlled** We treat only the angioma, not surrounding skin
✓ **Works on all sizes** From tiny pinpoint dots to larger spots
✓ **Clean healing** Minimal scarring when done properly by medical professionals

**Will they come back?**
The specific ruby points we remove won't grow back. However, if you're prone to developing cherry angiomas, new ones may appear elsewhere over time. We can treat those as they develop.

**How much does it cost?**
Pricing depends on how many ruby points you're having removed. We'll give you transparent pricing during your consultation. Most people find it more affordable than expected.

**Can I just leave them alone?**
Absolutely. Ruby points are harmless, so treatment is optional. Most people choose removal for cosmetic reasons—they want clear, even-toned skin without red spots. It's entirely your choice.

**What if they start bleeding?**
If you accidentally scratch or irritate a ruby point and it bleeds, apply gentle pressure with a clean cloth until the bleeding stops. They can bleed more than you'd expect because they're clusters of blood vessels, but the bleeding will stop. If it happens frequently, that's a good reason to have them removed.
