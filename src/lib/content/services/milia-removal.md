They look like tiny white pearls under your skin.

You've tried exfoliating. You've tried expensive creams. You've definitely considered squeezing them (it doesn't work). They just sit there—around your eyes, on your cheeks, across your nose—refusing to budge.

**Here's the truth:** Milia aren't like pimples or blackheads. They're tiny keratin cysts trapped under the skin's surface. No amount of scrubbing or popping will make them go away.

But professional extraction? That works. Fast.

At Vicaria Health, we remove milia safely and effectively—so you can stop obsessing over those little white bumps and get back to feeling confident in your skin.

## What Exactly Are Milia?

Let's clear this up.

Milia (singular: milium) are small, hard, white bumps caused by keratin—the same protein that makes up your hair and nails—getting trapped beneath your skin's surface.

They're incredibly common and can show up at any age, though they're especially frequent in:
- Newborns (baby milia usually go away on their own)
- Adults after skin damage, sun exposure, or certain skincare products
- People using heavy creams or oils that clog pores

**Where they appear:**
- Under and around the eyes
- Cheeks and nose
- Forehead
- Sometimes on the chest or genitals

Milia are **not** whiteheads. They're **not** pimples. They don't have an opening to the skin's surface, which is why squeezing them doesn't work—and can actually cause scarring or infection.

## Why Home Remedies Don't Work

You've probably tried:
- Exfoliating scrubs and peels
- Retinol creams
- "Pore clearing" treatments
- Picking at them with your nails or tweezers

**The problem?** Milia are trapped *under* the skin. Surface treatments can't reach them. And trying to extract them yourself risks damaging your skin, causing scarring, or introducing bacteria.

**Professional extraction is the only reliable way to remove milia.**

## How We Remove Milia Safely

We use a simple, proven technique: **sterile extraction**.

**Here's the process:**

1. **We clean and prepare the area** Ensuring everything is sterile to prevent infection
2. **We create a tiny opening** Using a sterile lancet or fine needle, we make a micro-incision in the skin's surface
3. **We extract the keratin** Gentle pressure removes the trapped keratin cyst cleanly
4. **That's it** The bump is gone, the opening heals within days

The entire process takes just a few minutes per milium. You might feel a tiny pinch when we make the opening, but it's quick and well-tolerated. Most people are surprised by how easy it is.

**Why professional extraction?**

✓ **Sterile technique** No risk of infection from dirty tools or fingers
✓ **Proper tools** Medical-grade instruments designed for precision
✓ **Minimal scarring** We know exactly how to extract without damaging surrounding tissue
✓ **Immediate results** The milia are gone the moment we remove them
✓ **Safe for delicate areas** Including around the eyes where skin is thin and sensitive

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Does it hurt?**
Most people feel a tiny pinch when we create the opening, but it's brief and very tolerable. The extraction itself is painless. We work gently and quickly.

**Will it leave scars?**
When done properly by medical professionals, milia extraction leaves minimal to no scarring. The micro-openings we create are incredibly small and heal cleanly within days.

**Can I just squeeze them myself?**
Please don't. Milia don't have a surface opening like pimples do, so squeezing won't work—it'll just irritate your skin, cause redness, and potentially lead to scarring or infection. Let us handle it safely.

**Will they come back?**
The specific milia we remove won't come back. However, if you're prone to milia, new ones may develop over time—especially if you use heavy skincare products or have sun damage. We can remove new ones as they appear.

**Can I wear makeup after?**
We recommend waiting 24 hours to let the tiny openings close completely. After that, makeup is fine.

**How much does it cost?**
Pricing depends on how many milia you're having removed. We'll give you transparent pricing during your consultation. Most people find it more affordable than they expected.

**What if I'm not sure they're milia?**
No problem. We'll examine the bumps and let you know exactly what they are. Sometimes what looks like milia is actually closed comedones (whiteheads), [seborrheic keratosis](/service/seborrheic-keratosis-removal) (waxy brown growths), [skin tags](/service/skin-tag-removal) (soft hanging flaps), or even [cherry angiomas](/service/ruby-points-treatment) (tiny red spots). We can identify the difference and recommend the right treatment.
