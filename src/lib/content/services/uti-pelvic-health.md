Another UTI. Again.

You feel that familiar burning. The urgency. The dread of another round of antibiotics that might work for a few weeks—until it happens again.

You've tried cranberry everything. You're meticulous about hygiene. You pee after sex, drink tons of water, avoid tight clothing. Your doctor says "some women are just prone to them" and hands you another prescription.

But living on antibiotics isn't a plan. And you're tired of the constant fear that every twinge might be another infection starting.

**Here's what no one tells you:** Recurrent UTIs aren't just bad luck. They're often a sign that something in your body's defense system needs support—whether that's your microbiome, your immune function, your hydration strategy, or factors you haven't even considered yet.

At Vicaria Health, we work with women across Hamilton—from Westdale to the Mountain, Dundas to Stoney Creek—who are ready to break the UTI cycle with root-cause strategies that actually prevent infections instead of just treating them.

## Why Antibiotics Alone Aren't Solving This

You already know the drill:
- Feel the symptoms starting
- Call your doctor or go to urgent care
- Get a prescription (or they culture it and you wait)
- Take antibiotics for 3–7 days
- Feel better... for a while
- Repeat in a few weeks or months

**The problem?** Antibiotics kill the infection, but they don't address why you keep getting them. In fact, repeated antibiotic use can make the problem worse by disrupting your vaginal and gut microbiome—the very defenses that protect you from infections.

Recurrent UTIs can be driven by:
- **Disrupted vaginal microbiome** — Not enough protective lactobacilli to keep harmful bacteria in check
- **Gut dysbiosis** — E. coli and other UTI-causing bacteria living in your digestive system
- **Inadequate hydration** — Concentrated urine allows bacteria to stick to bladder walls
- **Immune dysfunction** — Your body isn't clearing bacteria effectively
- **Structural or hormonal factors** — Low estrogen (perimenopause/menopause) or anatomical issues
- **Biofilm formation** — Bacteria hiding in bladder tissue that antibiotics can't reach

We don't just treat symptoms. We investigate and address the underlying patterns that make you susceptible.

## How We Help You Prevent Recurrent UTIs

We use a functional, root-cause approach built on evidence-based strategies:

**1. Microbiome Restoration**
Your vaginal and gut microbiome are your first line of defense. We use targeted probiotics, dietary strategies, and lifestyle interventions to rebuild protective bacterial populations that crowd out harmful strains.

**2. Immune & Bladder Support**
Nutrients like D-mannose, vitamin C, and targeted herbal antimicrobials can strengthen your urinary tract defenses and prevent bacterial adhesion—without the downsides of constant antibiotics.

**3. Hydration & Lifestyle Optimization**
Most people don't drink enough water, or they drink it inconsistently. We teach strategic hydration, urination timing, and hygiene practices tailored to your lifestyle and triggers.

**4. Root-Cause Investigation**
When appropriate, we use functional testing (comprehensive stool analysis, vaginal microbiome testing, urinalysis) to understand exactly what's driving your recurrences—so we're not guessing.

**5. Hormonal & Structural Considerations**
If you're in perimenopause or menopause, low estrogen can thin the vaginal and urethral tissue, making infections more likely. We address this through nutrition and work with your doctor if vaginal estrogen therapy makes sense.

- **Evidence-based protocols** — D-mannose, probiotics, cranberry extract, and dietary strategies backed by research

- **Functional testing when needed** — Microbiome analysis, immune markers, and metabolic testing to remove guesswork

- **Local to Hamilton** — Downtown clinic serving Westdale, Mountain, Dundas, Ancaster, Stoney Creek, Burlington—plus virtual clients across Ontario

## This Is for You If…

- You've had 3+ UTIs in the past year (or multiple in a short period)
- You're sick of taking antibiotics and worried about antibiotic resistance
- UTIs happen after sex, travel, or stress—and you want to break the pattern
- You're dealing with chronic pelvic pain, bladder urgency, or discomfort that your doctor can't explain
- You're in perimenopause or menopause and UTIs have become more frequent
- You want a **science-based prevention plan** — not just "drink more cranberry juice" advice

## What Clients Ask

**"Can I stop antibiotics completely?"**
Not necessarily—and we don't recommend stopping treatment for an active infection. But the goal is to prevent infections so you don't need antibiotics in the first place. Some women go from monthly UTIs to none at all once we address root causes.

**"Will I have to take supplements forever?"**
Not usually. We use targeted interventions (probiotics, D-mannose, etc.) to restore balance, then transition you to a maintenance plan based on your needs. Some women stay on minimal support; others don't need anything long-term.

**"What if I've already tried probiotics and they didn't help?"**
Most over-the-counter probiotics don't contain the right strains or high enough doses to impact the vaginal microbiome. We use research-backed, urogenital-specific strains and combine them with dietary and lifestyle strategies for better results.

**"Do I need to see a urologist first?"**
Not necessarily. But if you have structural issues, kidney involvement, or severe symptoms, we'll recommend medical evaluation first. We work alongside urologists and gynecologists when needed.

**"How long until I see improvement?"**
Many women notice fewer infections within 2–3 months. Long-term prevention builds over time as we restore microbiome balance and strengthen immune defenses.

**"Can you help with interstitial cystitis (IC) or painful bladder syndrome?"**
We provide supportive nutrition and lifestyle strategies for IC symptoms, but diagnosis and medical management require a urologist or pelvic pain specialist. We complement medical treatment.
