faqs:
  - question: "Can you treat active UTIs?"
    answer: "No. We cannot diagnose or treat active infections—that requires medical care and antibiotics. We focus on prevention strategies and addressing the underlying factors that make you susceptible to recurrent UTIs."
  - question: "How do you help prevent UTIs naturally?"
    answer: "We address multiple factors including hydration strategies, dietary changes, gut and vaginal microbiome support, proper hygiene habits, stress management, and identifying personal triggers that contribute to recurrence."
  - question: "How long until I see results?"
    answer: "Many clients experience fewer infections within 2–3 months as we implement protective strategies. Long-term prevention improves with consistent habits over time."
  - question: "Do you work with pelvic pain conditions?"
    answer: "We provide supportive coaching for lifestyle and dietary factors that may contribute to pelvic discomfort. For diagnosis and medical treatment of pelvic pain conditions, you'll need to work with a physician or pelvic health specialist."
