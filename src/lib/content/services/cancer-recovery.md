faqs:
  - question: "Is this a replacement for my oncologist?"
    answer: "No. We work alongside your oncology team to provide nutrition and lifestyle support during and after cancer treatment. We complement medical care, not replace it."
  - question: "Can you help during active treatment or only after?"
    answer: "Both. We support clients during active treatment (chemo, radiation) and in post-treatment recovery. Our approach is tailored to your current phase and needs."
  - question: "What if I have no appetite or food tastes bad?"
    answer: "This is very common. We provide practical strategies to manage taste changes, nausea, and low appetite—focusing on nutrient-dense options that work for you right now."
  - question: "Will you tell me what foods prevent cancer?"
    answer: "We focus on evidence-based nutrition that supports overall health, immune function, and recovery. We avoid unproven claims and work with what research actually supports."
  - question: "Do you offer online coaching?"
    answer: "Yes. We see clients in person at our downtown Hamilton office and virtually across Ontario."
  - question: "How much does coaching cost?"

You've completed treatment but now what?  
You’re tired, your appetite is unpredictable, and you’re not sure what’s safe to eat.  
Friends say “just eat healthy,” but you know recovery after cancer isn’t that simple.  
You want to regain strength, heal well, and reduce fear of recurrence without guesswork.

At Vicaria Health, we help people across Hamilton and the GTA rebuild their bodies after cancer treatment with nutrition that supports real healing.

## Why Recovery Feels So Unclear

After treatment, many people struggle with:

- Low energy and fatigue that doesn’t improve with rest  
- Loss of appetite or taste changes that make eating hard  
- Digestive issues from chemo or radiation  
- Fear of eating the “wrong foods” and increasing cancer risk  
- Confusion from conflicting advice online

**The problem isn’t your willpower it’s that post-cancer recovery is complex.**  
Your body has unique needs after chemo, radiation, surgery, or targeted therapy. You need a plan tailored to you, not generic “healthy eating” rules.

## How We Help You Recover Safely

Our approach combines compassion with evidence-based strategies:

**Personalized Nutrition for Healing & Strength**  
Gentle, anti-inflammatory meals to support tissue repair, energy, and immune balance.

**Digestive & Appetite Support**  
Strategies to restore appetite, manage nausea, and ease treatment-related gut issues.

**Relapse Risk Reduction Guidance**  
Evidence-based nutrition to lower long-term cancer risk without fear-based advice.

**Step-by-Step Support**  
We walk with you, helping you rebuild confidence around food and your body.

## Questions You’re Probably Asking

**Will this replace my oncologist’s advice?**  
No. We work alongside your medical team to complement your treatment and follow-up care. We help with daily habits and food choices while your doctors manage medication and monitoring.

**Do I need to wait before starting?**  
No. We work with people in different stages right after finishing treatment or months into recovery.

**Can you help if I’m still struggling with side effects like nausea or taste changes?**  
Yes. We provide practical strategies to improve appetite, manage nausea, and adapt your meals while healing.

**Will I have to give up my favorite foods?**  
Not necessarily. Our goal is balance, not restriction. We’ll focus on foods that support healing while keeping eating enjoyable.

**Do you work online?**  
Yes. We see clients in person at our downtown Hamilton clinic and virtually across Ontario.

**Is testing required?**
Not always. We can start with a thorough intake and adapt if lab insights could speed up recovery.
