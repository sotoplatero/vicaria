Look, I get it.

Your doctor says your numbers are too high. They hand you a prescription and tell you to "watch the salt." Maybe lose some weight. Manage your stress better.

You're trying. But three months later, you're back in that office and nothing's really changed.

The pills are doing their job, but you're tired of feeling like you're just managing a problem instead of actually fixing it.

**Here's the thing:** Generic advice doesn't work because it doesn't fit your actual life.

We help people right here in Hamilton from Westdale to the East End, Dundas to Stoney Creek build routines that actually stick. Not rules you follow for two weeks and then forget.

## Why "Cut the Salt" Isn't Getting You There

You already know you should eat better and stress less. That's not new information.

What you need is someone who understands your schedule, your food preferences, the reality of your day-to-day. Someone who won't hand you a meal plan you'll hate by Wednesday.

That's what we do at Vicaria Health.

We're in downtown Hamilton, but we work with people all over the city whether you're walking over from Durand or driving in from Ancaster. Some folks come to our office. Others prefer virtual sessions from home.

Either way, we meet you where you are.

## How We Actually Help

We focus on three areas that move the needle:

**Food That Works for Your Life**  
No bland chicken breast and steamed broccoli. We show you how to eat foods you genuinely enjoy including meals from your favorite Hamilton spots while supporting healthy blood pressure. You'd be surprised what actually works once you know how to put a plate together.

**Better Sleep and Real Stress Management**  
Poor sleep spikes your numbers faster than any saltshaker. Same with chronic stress. We help you build patterns that let your body actually rest and recover. Nothing woo-woo. Just practical shifts that fit into real life.

**Getting Out of Your Own Head About the Numbers**  
The anxiety around checking your blood pressure can become its own cycle. We help you change how you relate to those readings so you feel more in control, not less.

## Questions You Probably Have

**Does this replace my medication?**  
No. We work alongside your doctor, not instead of them. Many of our clients eventually reduce their medication with their physician's approval, but that's a decision you make together with your doctor. We never touch your meds that's not our job.

**How fast will I see changes?**  
Most people notice shifts within 4-6 weeks if they're consistent. Some see improvements in their readings within two weeks. It depends on where you're starting and how closely you follow through. We'll be honest with you about what's realistic.

**Am I going to eat bland, boring food?**  
Hell no. One of the biggest myths is that heart-healthy eating means tasteless meals. We teach you how to make food that actually tastes good. You live in Hamilton there's no shortage of great food here. You just need to know how to work with it.

**How much time does this take?**  
We meet once a week for 30-45 minutes. The changes you make don't add hours to your day they replace things you're already doing. Small tweaks, not a total life overhaul.

**What if I've already tried everything?**  
Good. That means you know what doesn't work. Most people who come to us have tried multiple approaches without success. The difference here is we don't do generic diets we build something that fits you specifically.

**Will you talk to my doctor?**  
Absolutely. We encourage it. Many of our clients share their progress with their doctors, and most physicians are thrilled to see genuine improvement without having to add more medication.

## Let's Talk

**Book a free 15-minute consultation.**

No pressure. No sales pitch. Just a real conversation about what's possible.
