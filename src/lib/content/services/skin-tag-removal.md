They snag on your necklace. They catch on your razor. They show up in photos and make you self-conscious.

Skin tags (acrochordons) are harmless, but they're annoying as hell—and you're definitely not alone in dealing with them. According to research published in the International Journal of Dermatology, skin tags affect approximately 46% of the general population, with prevalence increasing with age. The National Institutes of Health reports that skin tags are most common in people over 40, affecting up to 59% of adults by age 70. They're associated with friction, skin-to-skin contact, hormonal changes, and metabolic factors—including insulin resistance.

You've thought about cutting them off yourself (don't). You've tried those drugstore freeze kits (they don't work well). You just want them gone safely, quickly, and without a fuss.

**That's exactly what we do.**

We're medical doctors who remove skin tags every day. No drama. No judgment. Just quick, professional removal so you can stop thinking about them.

## Why People Wait (And Why You Don't Have To)

Most people live with skin tags for years before doing anything about them.

Maybe you think they're not "serious enough" to bother a doctor about. Maybe you assume it'll be expensive or complicated. Maybe you're just used to them being there.

**Here's the thing:** You don't have to live with them.

Removal takes minutes. It's straightforward. And you'll wonder why you didn't do it sooner.

We see people from all over Hamilton Westdale, the Mountain, Dundas, Ancaster who finally got tired of dealing with skin tags and just wanted them handled by someone who knows what they're doing.

## How We Remove Skin Tags

We use **electrocautery** a proven, precise medical technique that removes skin tags cleanly and effectively.

**Here's how it works:**

We apply a small electrical current directly to the skin tag at its base. This gently burns off the tissue and cauterizes (seals) the area instantly which means no bleeding, minimal discomfort, and clean results.

The entire process takes just a few minutes per skin tag. Most people describe it as a brief warm sensation or slight pinch nothing unbearable. For particularly sensitive areas, we can use a topical numbing agent to make it even more comfortable.

**Why electrocautery?**

✓ **Immediate results**: The skin tag is removed on the spot

✓ **No bleeding**: Cauterization seals the area instantly

✓ **Precise and controlled**: We treat only the skin tag, not surrounding tissue

✓ **Works on all sizes and locations**: Neck, underarms, eyelids, chest, anywhere

✓ **Minimal scarring**: When done properly, healing is clean and discreet

## What to Expect

**During Your Appointment:**
- We examine the skin tag(s) and confirm they're benign
- We clean and prepare the area
- We remove the tag using electrocautery
- We provide aftercare instructions
- You're done in 15-30 minutes depending on how many tags you're having removed

**After Removal:**
- Minor redness or scabbing that heals within a week or two
- Minimal scarring (usually none)

- You can go right back to your day no downtime

## Common Areas We Treat

We remove skin tags (acrochordons) from:
- **Neck and neckline** (jewelry irritation zones)
- **Underarms** (friction from clothing and shaving)
- **Eyelids** (carefully, with precision electrocautery)
- **Chest and décolletage** (common in both men and women)
- **Groin area** (skin-fold areas where friction occurs)
- **Under breasts** (where skin-on-skin contact creates irritation)
- **Anywhere they appear** on your body

Skin tags often develop in areas of friction or skin folds, which is why they're so common in these specific locations. Many of our clients who develop skin tags also have [seborrheic keratosis](/service/seborrheic-keratosis-removal), [milia](/service/milia-removal), or [ruby points](/service/ruby-points-treatment)—we can address multiple concerns in the same session.

If you're not sure whether what you have is a skin tag, we'll take a look and let you know. Sometimes what looks like a skin tag is actually a [seborrheic keratosis](/service/seborrheic-keratosis-removal) (a brown, waxy growth), [milia](/service/milia-removal) (tiny white bumps), or [cherry angioma](/service/ruby-points-treatment) (small red spots) we can tell the difference and treat each one appropriately.

- **Medical training and experience**: We know skin, anatomy, and how to handle complications if they arise
- **Proper sterilization and technique**: No risk of infection or scarring from DIY attempts
