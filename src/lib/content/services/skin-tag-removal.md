order: 1
faqs:
  - question: "Does it hurt?"
    answer: "Electrocautery causes minimal discomfort—most people describe it as a brief warm sensation or quick pinch. For sensitive areas or if you're particularly nervous, we can apply a topical numbing agent beforehand. Most people are surprised by how easy and quick it is."
  - question: "Will it leave a scar?"
    answer: "Rarely. When done properly by medical professionals, skin tag removal typically heals without visible scarring. The area may be slightly pink for a few weeks, then it fades."
  - question: "Can I just cut it off myself?"
    answer: "Please don't. Home removal risks infection, excessive bleeding, and scarring. Plus, if it's not actually a skin tag (if it's a mole or something else), cutting it yourself could cause problems. Let us handle it safely."
  - question: "How much does it cost?"
    answer: "Consultation fee is $60 CAD + taxes. Treatment pricing is $20-$25 per lesion (based on size and location) + taxes. We'll give you clear pricing during your consultation."
  - question: "Will they come back?"
    answer: "The specific skin tags we remove won't grow back. But if you're prone to skin tags, new ones may develop elsewhere over time. We can remove those too."

They snag on your necklace. They catch on your razor. They show up in photos and make you self-conscious.

Skin tags are harmless, but they're annoying as hell.

You've thought about cutting them off yourself (don't). You've tried those drugstore freeze kits (they don't work well). You just want them gone—safely, quickly, and without a fuss.

**That's exactly what we do.**

We're medical doctors who remove skin tags every day. No drama. No judgment. Just quick, professional removal so you can stop thinking about them.

## Why People Wait (And Why You Don't Have To)

Most people live with skin tags for years before doing anything about them.

Maybe you think they're not "serious enough" to bother a doctor about. Maybe you assume it'll be expensive or complicated. Maybe you're just used to them being there.

**Here's the thing:** You don't have to live with them.

Removal takes minutes. It's straightforward. And you'll wonder why you didn't do it sooner.

We see people from all over Hamilton—Westdale, the Mountain, Dundas, Ancaster—who finally got tired of dealing with skin tags and just wanted them handled by someone who knows what they're doing.

## How We Remove Skin Tags

We use **electrocautery** a proven, precise medical technique that removes skin tags cleanly and effectively.

**Here's how it works:**

We apply a small electrical current directly to the skin tag at its base. This gently burns off the tissue and cauterizes (seals) the area instantly—which means no bleeding, minimal discomfort, and clean results.

The entire process takes just a few minutes per skin tag. Most people describe it as a brief warm sensation or slight pinch—nothing unbearable. For particularly sensitive areas, we can use a topical numbing agent to make it even more comfortable.

**Why electrocautery?**

✓ **Immediate results**: The skin tag is removed on the spot

✓ **No bleeding**: Cauterization seals the area instantly

✓ **Precise and controlled**: We treat only the skin tag, not surrounding tissue

✓ **Works on all sizes and locations**: Neck, underarms, eyelids, chest, anywhere

✓ **Minimal scarring**: When done properly, healing is clean and discreet

If you're not sure whether what you have is a skin tag, we'll take a look and let you know. Sometimes what looks like a skin tag is actually a [seborrheic keratosis](/service/seborrheic-keratosis-removal) (a brown, waxy growth), [milia](/service/milia-removal) (tiny white bumps), or [cherry angioma](/service/ruby-points-treatment) (small red spots)—we can tell the difference and treat each one appropriately.

## Why Choose Medical Doctors for Skin Tag Removal

**We're physicians, not estheticians.** That matters when you're removing something from your skin.

- **Medical training and experience**: We know skin, anatomy, and how to handle complications if they arise
- **Proper sterilization and technique**: No risk of infection or scarring from DIY attempts
- **We can identify concerning lesions**: If something doesn't look like a normal skin tag, we know
- **Safe for all skin types**: We adjust technique for darker skin tones to prevent pigmentation issues
- **Located in downtown Hamilton**: Easy to reach from anywhere in the city
