# Get Rid of Those Annoying Skin Tags

**Vicaria Health | Downtown Hamilton**

---

They snag on your necklace. They catch on your razor. They show up in photos and make you self-conscious.

Skin tags are harmless, but they're annoying as hell.

You've thought about cutting them off yourself (don't). You've tried those drugstore freeze kits (they don't work well). You just want them gone—safely, quickly, and without a fuss.

**That's exactly what we do.**

We're medical doctors who remove skin tags every day. No drama. No judgment. Just quick, professional removal so you can stop thinking about them.

## Why People Wait (And Why You Don't Have To)

Most people live with skin tags for years before doing anything about them.

Maybe you think they're not "serious enough" to bother a doctor about. Maybe you assume it'll be expensive or complicated. Maybe you're just used to them being there.

**Here's the thing:** You don't have to live with them.

Removal takes minutes. It's straightforward. And you'll wonder why you didn't do it sooner.

We see people from all over Hamilton—Westdale, the Mountain, Dundas, Ancaster—who finally got tired of dealing with skin tags and just wanted them handled by someone who knows what they're doing.

## How We Remove Skin Tags

We use proven medical techniques based on the size and location of the skin tag:

**Cryotherapy (Freezing)**  
We apply liquid nitrogen to freeze the skin tag. It falls off within 7-10 days. Works great for smaller tags. Quick, minimal discomfort.

**Surgical Excision**  
For larger skin tags or ones in sensitive areas, we use a sterile blade or medical scissors to remove them cleanly. Local anesthetic keeps it comfortable. Takes minutes.

**Electrocautery (Burning)**  
We use a small electrical current to burn off the skin tag at the base. Stops bleeding immediately. Good for tags on the neck or underarms.

Which method we use depends on where the skin tag is, how big it is, and what makes sense for your skin type. We'll talk through it during your appointment.

## Common Areas We Treat

We remove skin tags from:
- Neck
- Underarms
- Eyelids
- Chest
- Groin area
- Under breasts

If you're not sure whether what you have is a skin tag, we'll take a look and let you know. Sometimes what looks like a skin tag is actually a mole or wart—we can tell the difference and treat accordingly.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Does it hurt?**  
Most methods cause minimal discomfort—maybe a quick pinch or slight burning sensation. If we're doing surgical excision, we use local anesthetic so you don't feel it. Most people are surprised by how easy it is.

**Will it leave a scar?**  
Rarely. When done properly by medical professionals, skin tag removal typically heals without visible scarring. The area may be slightly pink for a few weeks, then it fades.

**Can I just cut it off myself?**  
Please don't. Home removal risks infection, excessive bleeding, and scarring. Plus, if it's not actually a skin tag (if it's a mole or something else), cutting it yourself could cause problems. Let us handle it safely.

**How much does it cost?**  
Depends on how many skin tags you're having removed and which removal method we use. We'll give you clear pricing during your consultation. Most people find it much more affordable than they expected.

**Will they come back?**  
The specific skin tags we remove won't grow back. But if you're prone to skin tags, new ones may develop elsewhere over time. We can remove those too.

**Is this covered by insurance?**  
Usually not—skin tag removal is typically considered cosmetic. However, if a skin tag is in a location where it causes irritation, bleeding, or interferes with daily activities, some insurance plans may cover it. We can provide documentation if needed.
