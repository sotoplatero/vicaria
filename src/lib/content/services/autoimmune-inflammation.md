You wake up stiff, sore, and drained.  
Your joints ache. Swelling comes and goes. Some days you’re exhausted before you even start.  
Doctors may have said “autoimmune,” “inflammation,” or simply shrugged. You’ve tried diets, supplements, maybe every wellness trend on Instagram — and nothing sticks.

**Here’s what no one tells you:** chronic inflammation has causes. They can be identified, calmed, and managed with the right plan — not endless guessing.

At Vicaria Health, we work with people right here in Hamilton — from Westdale to the Mountain, Dundas to Stoney Creek — who are ready to stop fighting their own body and finally feel better.

## Why Generic Advice Isn’t Helping

You’ve probably tried:
- Cutting gluten, dairy, nightshades — and still feel inflamed.  
- Supplements everyone swears by but you can’t tell if they do anything.  
- “Anti-inflammatory diets” from random blogs that don’t address your real triggers.  
- Resting more but waking up just as tired.

**The issue isn’t lack of effort — it’s lack of a personalized, root-cause approach.**

Autoimmune flares and chronic inflammation can be driven by:  
- Immune dysregulation and gut barrier issues  
- Chronic stress and nervous system overload  
- Food sensitivities unique to you  
- Infections or imbalances (like SIBO) making your immune system overreact

We don’t guess. We assess, test when needed, and create a clear plan that fits your life.

## How We Actually Help Calm Inflammation

We use a root-cause, functional approach built on three pillars:

**Targeted Nutrition — Without Extreme Restrictions**  
We identify what truly triggers your flares and build a practical anti-inflammatory eating pattern that’s sustainable — not endless elimination.

**Stress & Nervous System Regulation**  
Chronic stress keeps inflammation high. We teach tools to calm the fight-or-flight response so your body can heal.

**Recovery & Lifestyle Strategies**  
Better sleep, movement tailored to your condition, and energy pacing that prevents crashes and flares.

## Questions You’re Probably Asking

**Is this a replacement for my rheumatologist or doctor?**  
No. We work alongside your medical team to complement treatment. We help you build the habits and nutrition strategies your body needs while your doctor manages medication.

**Do I need a confirmed autoimmune diagnosis?**  
No. Many clients come to us with chronic inflammation, fatigue, or pain but no formal diagnosis. We can still help you find triggers and calm symptoms.

**How long until I feel improvement?**  
Most people notice more energy and less pain within weeks. Deep, lasting change usually takes 2–3 months as your immune system stabilizes and new habits stick.

**Is this just about food?**  
No. Food matters, but stress, sleep, gut health, and nervous system regulation are key. We look at the whole picture.

**Do you work online?**  
Yes. We see clients in person at our downtown Hamilton office and virtually across Ontario.

**Will testing be required?**  
Not always. We can start without it, but when needed, we use targeted labs to speed up results and remove guesswork.
