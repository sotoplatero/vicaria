faqs:
  - question: "Is this different from seeing a general dietitian?"
    answer: "Yes. General dietitians provide broad nutrition advice. An IBS nutritionist focuses specifically on digestive symptom patterns, trigger identification, and IBS-specific protocols like Low FODMAP. We understand the nuances of IBS subtypes (IBS-D, IBS-C, IBS-M) and tailor strategies accordingly."
  - question: "Do you help with Low FODMAP diets?"
    answer: "Absolutely. We're trained in proper Low FODMAP implementation—including when to use it, when NOT to use it, and how to reintroduce foods safely. Most people who 'tried FODMAP and it didn't work' either didn't eliminate properly or got stuck in restriction mode. We guide you through the full process correctly."
  - question: "Can nutrition help IBS without medication?"
    answer: "For many people, yes. Nutrition is often the primary intervention for IBS symptom management. That said, we work alongside your medical team—not instead of them. Some clients use nutrition as their main strategy, others combine it with medication or other therapies."
  - question: "How long does it take to see improvement?"
    answer: "Most clients notice symptom changes within 2-4 weeks as we identify and adjust triggers. Building long-term stability takes 2-3 months as we fine-tune your personalized approach and establish sustainable eating patterns."
  - question: "Do you offer virtual sessions?"
    answer: "Yes. We see clients both in person in Hamilton and virtually across Ontario. IBS nutrition support works well remotely since we focus on patterns, triggers, and strategies rather than physical assessments."
  - question: "What if I've already tried elimination diets?"
    answer: "Most elimination diets fail because they're either too broad (cutting everything) or too generic (cutting the 'common triggers' that might not be YOUR triggers). We use systematic approaches to identify YOUR specific patterns, then build a diverse diet around what actually works for your body."

## Looking for an IBS Dietitian Near You?

You've been here before: standing in front of the fridge, trying to remember what made you feel terrible last week. Was it the onions? The apples? Stress from work? All of it?

If you're searching for an IBS dietitian near you, you already know generic nutrition advice doesn't cut it. "Eat more fiber." "Avoid spicy foods." "Just relax." None of that helps when your symptoms feel random and your triggers seem invisible.

**You don't need more diet rules. You need someone who understands IBS specifically** and can help you figure out what's actually going on in your gut.

That's exactly what we do. We work with people in Hamilton—and virtually across Ontario—who are tired of guessing and ready for a systematic, personalized approach to managing IBS through nutrition.

## Who IBS Nutrition Support Is For

This is for you if you're dealing with:

- **Ongoing bloating, gas, or abdominal pain** that disrupts your day
- **Alternating constipation and diarrhea** (or mostly one or the other)
- **Symptoms triggered by food** but you can't figure out the pattern
- **IBS diagnosis or suspected IBS** and you don't know where to start
- **Tried generic diets** (gluten-free, dairy-free, "clean eating") without lasting success
- **Avoiding more and more foods** out of fear, with no clear improvement
- **Social anxiety around eating** because you never know how your body will react

If you're planning your life around bathroom access or turning down invitations because food situations feel unpredictable—**this is for you.**

We serve clients throughout Hamilton (Westdale, Dundas, Ancaster, Stoney Creek, the Mountain) and virtually across Ontario. Whether you're looking for a dietician for IBS near you or prefer remote support, we'll build a plan that fits your life.

## IBS-Focused Nutrition, Not Generic Advice

Here's the thing about working with a general nutritionist versus an **IBS nutritionist**: IBS isn't just "sensitive digestion." It's a complex condition with different subtypes, overlapping triggers, and individual symptom patterns.

**What makes IBS nutrition support different:**

### We Don't Give You Someone Else's Diet Plan

That meal plan that worked for your friend with IBS? Probably won't work for you. IBS-D (diarrhea-predominant) needs different strategies than IBS-C (constipation-predominant). Your triggers aren't the same as someone else's triggers.

**We build YOUR plan based on YOUR patterns.**

### We Use a Symptom-Driven Approach

Instead of eliminating random "common IBS triggers," we track your actual symptoms to identify what's really causing problems. We're looking for connections you might not see on your own—timing patterns, food combinations, stress interactions, sleep impacts.

### We Know When to Use Low FODMAP (and When Not To)

Low FODMAP isn't a lifelong diet. It's a diagnostic tool. We're trained FODMAP nutritionists who understand:
- When Low FODMAP is appropriate
- How to implement it correctly (most people don't)
- When to reintroduce foods (this is where most people get stuck)
- How to avoid unnecessary long-term restriction

**If you're looking for a dietician for IBS near you who actually understands these nuances, you're in the right place.**

We're located in downtown Hamilton and work with clients across the city—plus virtual clients who want IBS-specific expertise without geographic limits.

## Low FODMAP Guidance With Professional Support

You've probably heard of the Low FODMAP diet. Maybe you've tried it. Maybe you're scared to try it because it seems overwhelming. Maybe you tried it and it "didn't work."

**Here's what you need to know about working with a Low FODMAP diet dietitian:**

### When Low FODMAP Helps

Low FODMAP is one of the most effective interventions for IBS—**when used correctly**. Research shows about 75% of people with IBS see symptom improvement during the elimination phase.

It works best for:
- IBS with bloating and gas as primary symptoms
- People who suspect food triggers but can't identify them
- Those who haven't responded to simpler elimination strategies

### When It Does NOT Help (and What We Do Instead)

Low FODMAP isn't the answer for everyone. If you have:
- Primarily stress-triggered symptoms (gut-brain axis work is more effective)
- SIBO that hasn't been treated (needs antimicrobials first)
- Severe anxiety around food restriction (may worsen disordered eating patterns)

**We'll tell you if Low FODMAP isn't right for you** and recommend alternative approaches instead. That's the difference between working with a FODMAP nutritionist versus trying to DIY it from blog posts.

### Reintroduction Matters More Than Elimination

Here's where most people get stuck: they eliminate FODMAPs, feel better, and then... stay restricted forever out of fear.

**That's not how it's supposed to work.**

The reintroduction phase is where you figure out:
- Which FODMAPs YOU actually react to (not all of them)
- What your threshold is (you might tolerate small amounts fine)
- How to build a diverse, sustainable diet

We guide you through this systematically. No guessing. No staying restricted longer than necessary.

### Avoid Long-Term Restriction Mistakes

Staying low FODMAP forever can:
- Reduce beneficial gut bacteria
- Create nutritional deficiencies
- Increase food anxiety
- Limit your social flexibility

**Our goal: help you eat as freely as possible while managing symptoms.**

If you're searching for a nutritionist specializing in IBS near you who knows how to use Low FODMAP strategically (not as a permanent restriction), that's exactly what we do.

## How IBS Nutrition Support Works

Working with us isn't about following a pre-made meal plan or checking in once a month. It's systematic, personalized, and designed to actually solve the problem.

**Here's the process:**

### 1. Initial IBS Symptom Assessment

We start with a comprehensive intake to understand:
- Your symptom patterns (when, where, how intense)
- What you've already tried and what happened
- Your current diet and eating habits
- Stress factors, sleep quality, lifestyle patterns
- Whether you have IBS-D, IBS-C, IBS-M, or unspecified IBS

This isn't a 15-minute chat. We dig deep so we're working with accurate information, not assumptions.

### 2. Personalized Nutrition Strategy

Based on your assessment, we build your initial protocol. This might include:
- Targeted elimination (Low FODMAP or other approaches)
- Specific fiber adjustments based on your IBS subtype
- Meal timing and eating rhythm strategies
- Supplements if appropriate (we don't guess—we recommend based on evidence)

**You'll know exactly what to do, why you're doing it, and what to expect.**

### 3. Trigger Identification and Adjustments

As you implement your protocol, we track symptoms and identify patterns. We adjust based on:
- What's working and what isn't
- Symptom changes (positive or negative)
- Practical challenges in your real life
- Reintroduction testing if using elimination protocols

This is where working with a **nutritionist for IBS near you** (or virtually) makes the biggest difference. You're not figuring this out alone.

### 4. Ongoing Support and Refinement

IBS management isn't a one-time fix. It's about building a sustainable approach that works long-term. We provide:
- Regular check-ins to troubleshoot and adjust
- Support through reintroduction phases
- Strategies for handling setbacks or flare-ups
- Guidance on maintaining flexibility while managing symptoms

**By the end, you'll understand your body's patterns well enough to manage confidently on your own.**

## Common Questions About IBS Nutrition Support

**Is this different from seeing a general dietitian?**

Yes. A general dietitian covers broad nutrition topics. We focus specifically on IBS—symptom patterns, trigger identification, IBS-specific protocols like Low FODMAP, and the gut-brain connection that most practitioners miss.

We've worked with clients who saw general dietitians and got generic advice ("eat more fiber," "avoid dairy") that didn't address their specific triggers or IBS subtype.

**Do you help with Low FODMAP diets?**

Absolutely. We're trained in proper Low FODMAP implementation, which means:
- Knowing when it's appropriate (and when it's not)
- Guiding you through elimination correctly (most people miss key details)
- Supporting systematic reintroduction (where most DIY attempts fail)
- Helping you build a diverse diet after identifying your specific triggers

We're **FODMAP nutritionists** who use the protocol strategically, not as a permanent restriction.

**Can nutrition help IBS without medication?**

For many people, yes. Nutrition is often the primary intervention for IBS symptom management. Research shows dietary changes can be as effective as medication for many IBS patients.

That said, we work alongside your medical team—we don't replace them. Some clients manage IBS primarily through nutrition. Others combine it with medications or other therapies.

**How long does it take to see improvement?**

Most clients notice symptom changes within 2-4 weeks as we identify and remove or reduce major triggers. Building long-term stability and flexibility takes 2-3 months as we:
- Fine-tune your personalized approach
- Complete reintroduction phases if using elimination protocols
- Establish sustainable eating patterns that work in real life

**Do you offer virtual sessions?**

Yes. We see clients both in person in Hamilton and virtually across Ontario. IBS nutrition support translates well to virtual sessions since we're focused on symptom patterns, triggers, and strategies rather than physical assessments.

Virtual works great if you're outside Hamilton, prefer the convenience of home sessions, or get anxious about commuting with IBS symptoms.

**What if I've already tried elimination diets?**

Most elimination diets fail for predictable reasons:
- Eliminating too broadly (cutting everything, feeling deprived, giving up)
- Eliminating too generically (removing "common triggers" that might not be YOUR triggers)
- No systematic reintroduction (getting stuck in restriction)
- Not addressing other IBS factors (stress, eating patterns, gut-brain axis)

**We use evidence-based, systematic approaches** that identify YOUR specific patterns and help you build a sustainable, diverse diet—not permanent restriction.

If you've tried elimination before and it didn't work, that doesn't mean YOU failed. It usually means the approach was flawed.

**How much does IBS nutrition support cost?**

We offer a free 15-minute consultation to discuss your IBS symptoms, what you've tried, and whether our approach makes sense for your situation.

Program details and pricing are covered during that conversation based on your specific needs. No pressure, no sales pitch—just an honest discussion about what it takes to manage IBS effectively.
